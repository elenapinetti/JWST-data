# Abstract
I present the first constraints on QCD axion dark matter using measurements from the James
Webb Space Telescope. By utilizing publicly available MIRI and NIRSpec blank-sky observations,
originally collected for sky subtraction purposes, I derive strong limits on the axion-photon coupling
constant $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ in the mass range 0.1-4 eV. These constraints improve upon previous studies by more
than two orders of magnitude for a range of masses. This analysis underscores the potential of
blank-sky observations as a powerful tool for constraining dark matter models and demonstrates
how astrophysical missions can be repurposed for particle physics research.
